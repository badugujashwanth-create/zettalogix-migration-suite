# Troubleshooting

## Installation fails

Use the package manager and lockfile already committed to this repository. Confirm the required runtime is installed, clear only generated caches, and retry the install command from [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## The application starts but a feature is unavailable

Check the browser or terminal error first, then verify the documented environment variables and dependent services. Only frontend and desktop-shell code are present. The backend is external and was not modified or claimed as included.

## Tests and builds

Run checks from the component directory shown in [TEST_REPORT.md](TEST_REPORT.md). A successful dependency install is not evidence that a test or production build passed.

## Sensitive configuration

Never paste real credentials into an issue or screenshot. Replace local configuration values with placeholders before sharing diagnostic output.
